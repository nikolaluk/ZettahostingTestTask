# Project Documentation

## Introduction

I'm sure you already know how to clone a git repository and run a Vite development server but just in case I have put up a quick documentation. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikolaluk/ZettahostingTestTask.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd zettahosting-task

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

## Running the dev server

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Project structure

Since this is a fairly small project I have divided the components in two folders. Shared and Core with every component having markup and css in a seperate folder.

Other than that everything else follows the reactJS and Vite conventions: public, asset and service directories, contexts etc.
